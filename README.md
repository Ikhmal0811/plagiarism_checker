# wordle_copy
Trying to make wordle copy to learn more about python

After failing to get into 42KL i'm not going to give up yet.

This project is done using vim on linux. I don't want to forget the skills that I learned during the piscine. This is not the end. Anyone that reading this, please ignore this README file as its just my frustation not doing my best during the programme.

ps: I actually want to make a plagiarism checker but I dont know anything about python at the time that I was doing this. Please ignore the title xD.

Regards,
Malmi
